# WOSET 2020


Third Workshop on Open-Source EDA Technology (http://woset.org).

Co-located with ICCAD 2020, November 5, San Diego Mission Bay Resort

The WOSET workshop aims to galvanize the open-source EDA movement. The workshop will bring together EDA researchers who are committed to open-source principles to share their experiences and coordinate efforts towards developing a reliable, fully open-source EDA flow. The workshop will feature presentations and posters that overview existing or under-development open-source tools, designs and technology libraries. A live demo session for tools in advanced state will be planned. The workshop will feature a panel on the present status and future challenges open-source EDA, and how to coordinate efforts and ensure quality and interoperability across open-source tools. A cash award will be given for a Best Tool Award.

Submissions (2-4 pages):
* Overview of an existing or under-development open-source EDA tool.
* Overview of support infrastructure (e.g. EDA databases and design benchmarks).
* Open-source cloud-based EDA tools
* Position statements (e.g. critical gaps, blockers/obstacles)

Important dates:
* Sept 6th 2020: submission due date.
* Sept 15th 2020: notification due date.
