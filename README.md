# Workshop on Open-Source EDA Technology


The WOSET workshop aims to galvanize the open-source EDA movement. The
workshop will bring together EDA researchers who are committed to
open-source principles to share their experiences and coordinate
efforts towards developing a reliable, fully open-source EDA flow. The
workshop will feature presentations and posters that overview existing
or under-development open-source tools, designs and technology
libraries. A live demo session for tools in advanced state will be
planned. The workshop will feature a panel on the present status and
future challenges in open-source EDA, and how to coordinate efforts
and ensure quality and interoperability across open-source tools.
