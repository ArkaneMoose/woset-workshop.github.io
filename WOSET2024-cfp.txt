*** Workshop on Open Source EDA Technologies (WOSET) ***

https://woset-workshop.github.io/

Virtual! No registration fee! 

The WOSET workshop aims to galvanize the open-source EDA movement. The
workshop will bring together EDA researchers who are committed to
open-source principles to share their experiences and coordinate
efforts towards developing a reliable, fully open-source EDA flow. The
workshop will feature presentations and posters that overview existing
or under-development open-source tools, designs and technology
libraries. A live demo session for tools in advanced state will be
planned. The workshop will feature a panel on the present status and
future challenges in open-source EDA, and how to coordinate efforts
and ensure quality and interoperability across open-source tools.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Overview of an existing or under-development open-source EDA tool.
* Overview of support infrastructure (e.g. EDA databases and design benchmarks).
* Open-source cloud-based EDA tools
* Open-source hardware designs
* Position statements (e.g. critical gaps, blockers/obstacles)
